# Looking-Glass
Looking Glass is software designed to make it easy to manage your windows on the Windows OS.
Looking Glass provides the user several hotkeys that allow for easy window resizing. It is inspired by and similar to the [Spectacle](https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle) app for Mac OS X.

Looking Glass is still an early work in progress.

The following features are planned for Looking Glass:
* Flexible window resizing
* Customizable hotkey support
* Multi-Monitor support
* Easy installation for Windows users
* Remote window management
  * e.g. being able to manage Window A while Window B is in focus
