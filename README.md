# Looking Glass
Looking Glass is software designed to make it easy to manage your windows on the Windows OS.
Looking Glass provides the user several hotkeys that allow for easy window resizing. It is inspired by and similar to the [Spectacle](https://github.com/eczarny/spectacle) app for Mac OS X.

Looking Glass is still an early work in progress.

The following features are planned for Looking Glass:
* Flexible window resizing
* Customizable hotkey support
* Multi-Monitor support
* Easy installation for Windows users
* Remote window management
  * e.g. being able to manage Window A while Window B is in focus

TODO:
* Disable keyboard from typing while command for resizing is being used
* Consider disabling (Windows Key + Arrow Key) window movement built into Windows, and using Windows key as functional key instead
* Handle all resolutions properly, including odd ones like 1368x768 (~16.008:9), 16:10, etc
* Explore error when handling windows with transparency (window goes right then locks to left when pressing Shift Alt Right)
  * e.g. cmder (?)
